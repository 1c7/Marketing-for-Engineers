## :triumph: Marketing without Budget
You will find here a collection of free marketing channels for getting the first users. Most of it will take a lot of time & effort, but will not actually cost money to do it yourself. Some channels, like Content Marketing or Influencer Marketing, are comprehensively explained in its own directories below. So, get fresh ideas from these real-life stories and think what could work for your users:
* [Do Things that Don't Scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) by Paul Graham. He is a co-founder of Y Combinator, computer scientist, investor, and entrepreneur. Paul shows how such popular companies as Stripe, Airbnb or Facebook got their first users. It's more philosophical read for helping your brain to think in the right direction. 
* [How to Grow Your Startup on a $0 Marketing Budget](https://producthabits.com/how-to-grow-your-startup-on-a-0-marketing-budget/) by Hiten Shah. It highlights a bunch of ideas to try.
* Here is Product Hunt story! [How We Got Our First 2,000 Users Doing Things That Don’t Scale](https://www.fastcompany.com/3024472/how-we-got-our-first-2000-users-doing-things-that-dont-scale) by amazing [Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover), co-founder of Product Hunt.
* [Comment Marketing: How to Earn Benefits from Community Participation](https://moz.com/blog/comment-marketing-how-to-earn-benefits-from-community-participation-whiteboard-friday) by Rand Fishkin. You can gain attention to your company via sharing meaningful opinions and thoughts. Rand Fishkin made an exelent 9 minutues how-to video on it!
* If you have difficult product with many varying use cases, you can try to [use free products for lead generation](https://blog.clearbit.com/how-were-using-free-tools-to-engage-developers/). It's a great way to show benefits of your main offering and increase brand awareness. This post shows how to sell Clearbit API-solution via free high-valuable & easy-to-use tools. You can invest your time and make some free stuff as well. It can be anything, that gives a taste of your main product — UI kits, browser extensions, open source tools. By the way, open source products can tremendously grow loyalty to your brand! :heart_eyes: I love OS React-Sketchapp and Lottie from Airbnb Design team.
* Promotion via freebies is a powerful tool to get emails of prospect leads. 


We used many free marketing channels. 

To be honest, when we started [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/) we didn't have other ways. We wrote cold emails, talk to influencers, manually recruit users at events, post at Facebook developers groups, worked with developers/designers via Twitter and did many other clever tricks. 🎉 These gave us our first 1000 beta users 🎉 So it worth trying out!
  
## Content Marketing 
Content Marketing is about promotion via content. You can run your personal blog, do guest-blogging or write at the popular industry platforms (or combine it). Focus on how you can help your users with your content. You don't have to be a professional writer for making cool articles. Just give yourself space to be creative and share your expertise. I encourage you to do a content-marketing by yourself because outsourcing it can be tricky (especially at the beginning).

🤔 First, think how your blog or content is you going to stand out. There are plenty of cool blogs in every industry. How are you going to be different? What unique value can you offer that nobody else has yet?

Next step is to creat a content-plan. Pick a schedule and write consistently on it.

:see_no_evil: Please, always check your grammar! I use these cool apps — [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), [Ginger Grammar Checker](http://www.gingersoftware.com/grammarcheck) or browser extensions. Now it's time to write your first article :metal:

### :sunglasses: Personal Blog
Start off by creating a blog that not only touts your product but offers helpful advice, tips, tricks, links, etc. I know, that you would like to write a deep comprehansive article, but it's better to write something easy at the beginning. Check what competitors' blogs are publishing, what is popular in the industry or just scroll these [266 blog post ideas](https://midasmedia.co.uk/killer-blog-post-ideas-no-more-writers-block/). More advices on getting ideas for your blog and make writing a bit easier:

* [How We Come Up With Ideas for the Blog](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/blog-post-ideas/) by Emily Triplett Lentz from Help Scout team.
* [How to Generate Content Ideas With These 3 Awesome Tools](http://buzzsumo.com/blog/how-to-generate-content-ideas-with-these-3-awesome-tools/). Robert Katai shows how to use tools, that find out what people were asking about your industry (via keywords). 
* [Here’s How to Use Your Daily Habits For Writing Better Content in Less Time](https://moz.com/blog/heres-how-to-use-your-daily-habits-for-writing-better-content-in-less-time) by Lesley J. Vos.

When you generated ideas, put them into your content plan (do all your ideas suit choosen content topics?). Pick the most approprite content format for your idea (video, list, long-read). Think about the right headlines for driving interest to your great article: 
* [Research on writing viral headlines](http://buzzsumo.com/blog/5-ways-create-amazing-viral-headlines/)
* [30+ Ultimate Headline Formulas](https://blog.bufferapp.com/headline-formulas)

Craft blog with SEO focus:
* [The Complete Guide to Blog SEO](http://webris.org/blog-seo-how-to-optimize-your-blog-for-google/). Ryan Stewart covers more than just making your blog SEO-frinedly. He talks about blog strategy, keyword research and promotion of your blog via building links to posts.
* [The 10 Types of Content That Work Best for SEO](https://moz.com/blog/the-ten-types-of-content-that-work-best-for-seo-whiteboard-friday) by Rand Fishkin.

To give you an example, for [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/) we took topics around iOS dev best practise, "design for beginners", "how to market your app". Writing one artilce takes me minimun 3-4 days (five A4 pages). Be ready to invest a lot of time in writing, proofreading, styling! We decided to use Medium, as we didn't have time to make\maintane a personal blog at our website. 

### :green_book: Medium Marketing
Medium is an online publishing platform with the huge active community. You can make your blog there and engage with your users and Medium readers. I want also show you the downside of using Medium versus your own blog:
- Lower Conversion. 
You can get huge traffic to your Medium blog, but it doesn’t mean that people will go to your website or offering.
- No magic with getting traffic
You still need to promote your articles yourself. Medium is a high-traffic community, but you are not teh only one who competes for attention.

Publishing on Medium or elsewhere removes all your technology hassles. It's a good place to start implemenating your content marketing strategy :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

### :mega: Promotion of your content
As you have already understood, you need to promote your content both for your own blog, Medium-like platforms or guest post at other blogs. Here some ideas how to promote your great articles: 

* You can use some of these [38 Free Places to Promote Blog Posts Once You Hit Publish](http://www.mybloglift.com/places-to-promote-blog-posts/). Learn about every platform before sharing your content there (or you will become a spammer!)

Content Marketing is not only about getting people to read your amazing articles (and use your product later). It's also about developing and maintaining relationships with audience. You have to creat dialog with your readers and constanly be improving.


## Influencer Marketing
Influencer marketing is a type of marketing that focuses on working with opinion leaders to drive a brand's message\product\service to the larger market.

* [What is influencer marketing and how to find influencers?](https://blog.bufferapp.com/influencer-marketing) by Ash Read from Buffer.

Usefull tools:
* [SocialHunt] helps you to monitor a group of chosen Twitter profiles. You can receive people's activities in your email hourly\weekly and engage with them. 
* Use RSS apps for getting content from influencers' blogs. You can comment those posts and share good one via your social media. [Selfoss](https://selfoss.aditu.de/) is a good RSS app. It's an open source, so you may dig into its code and customize things.
* [Followerwonk](https://moz.com/followerwonk/analyze/) gives a huge base of data about any Twitter user. 


## :cat: Marketing for Product Hunt Launch 
Product Hunt (PH) is a place to discover, share, and geek out about new products in tech. Submitting your product there is a good way to appear in front of journalists, tech people and fellow makers. After submission, the product will participate in the daily race. The race starts PST 00:00 and finishes PST 23:59. You have to get as many upvotes and comments as you can by the end of the day! :trophy: The most successful products appear on the Homepage and can get many honest feedback, downloads, users and PR buzz. Please, check success PH stories to decide if PH is the right launch platform for you!

Start with [basic rules on Posting](https://help.producthunt.com/posting): how to post or comment, how to ask for support, how to get to the homepage. Then read [Five things everyone should know about Product Hunt](https://medium.com/product-hunt/five-things-everyone-should-know-about-product-hunt-fac74f44c32b). Join the PH community and feel how it works, before actually starting you launch activities.

:scream: Successful PH launch takes a lot of preparation, promotion during the launch (24h++) and follow-up work. These guides will help you:

* [Product Hunt 101](https://medium.com/swlh/product-hunt-101-426511f03501) from one of the top hunters, Robleh Jama. It's very useful to listen to the launch algorithm from the person, who submit a lot of different products.
* [The SaaS founder’s guide to Product Hunt](https://blog.amplifr.com/en/amplifr-on-producthunt/) from the Russian company, Amplifr. It's a nice tutorial around your product preparation (onboarding, language check, emails and other not obvious stuff).
* [Launching on Product Hunt: what works and what doesn’t [guide & case study]](https://hackernoon.com/launching-on-product-hunt-what-works-and-what-doesnt-guide-case-study-776c77d56e26) by 3D modeling app startup, who lauhcned on Product Hunt in December 2016. These folks have not typical "sweet product for startup audience" and their launch was "so-so" useful. I encourage you to think about resources you will invest in PH launch versus possible outcome!

Useful tools:
* [Notify](https://notify.ly/) notifies you in Slack when your startup is mentioned online. That helps you to answer\react quickly if somebody talks about your product (feedback, question). The tool is free. 
* [MakerTools](http://makertools.xyz/) allows you to create a Twitter list of all the wonderful folks who upvoted your product. It's a good practice to thank those people for supporting you via Twitter 😍
* [Crisp Live Chat](https://crisp.im/en/) is very useful during your launch campaign when people ask things in a real-time. Such communication can increase conversion at your site and give you a lot of insights. We use the free version and it's awesome so far. 

## Social Media Marketing

* [How to Create a Social Media Marketing Strategy From Scratch](https://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-marketing-plan) by Kevan Lee, Buffer Marketing Director. It's a comprehensive long-read about basic on SMM stategy. 

When you have multiple Social Media accounts, use dashboards & tools for managing them in one place. My favoirity ones are [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) and [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) (both have free options). These tools have build-in analitics. So you can pick simple metrics that are meaningful and can be analyzed. 

My SMM toolbox:
* [Pablo](https://pablo.buffer.com/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) for fast creating of nice-looking images (both free).
* [Nuzzel](http://nuzzel.com/) can show you the top content being shared among all your followers on Twitter and Facebook. You can use that content for sharing or as example. It's free tool.
* [Google Analytics Campaign URL builder](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/) for making UTM codes and here is guide on [Using UTM Parameters to Track Social Media Success](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-use-utm-parameters/) from Hootsuite.
 

### Twitter

* [Twitter Deep Dive: How to Use Social Media to 10x Your Website Traffic](https://moz.com/blog/twitter-deep-dive-10x-your-website-traffic-whiteboard-friday) by Tara Reed. Tara shared a cool guide on building Twitter strategy and automating your engagement workflow. 
* [I Automated My Tweets for 30 Days and This is What Happened](https://inbound.org/blog/i-automated-my-tweets-for-30-days-and-this-is-what-happened) via inbound.org.

Follow-Unfollow game is tricky. Using such tools can give your company Twitter "first followers". But in most cases, it will be bots or inactive users:
* [Is “fake” Twitter following working?](https://aggregateblog.com/automated-twitter-following-tools/)

Be aware of [Twitter tweet & DM limit](https://support.twitter.com/articles/15364). 

And these tools help you maximize your Twitter presence, from timing to sharing to the analysis:

## :email: Email Marketing
I know what you are thinking right now: "nobody cares about emails". Well, do you have your favorite newsletters? Do you love discount emails from your favorite dev tool? I bet, the answer is "yes" :smirk: The goal of email marketing is to turn email addresses into loyal users or prospect partners. 

### Product emails 
Product emails 

The goal of onboarding is to increase the number of users who actually use your product (or free trial) and pay for it later. Onboarding process can be done not only via emails. You can reach out to users through in-app messages, live chat messages, product tours, welcome modal windows, well-crafted UX or even phone calls :telephone_receiver:. For [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/) we decided to use a combination of triggered onboarding emails and in-app notifications. I will focus mostly on onboarding emails because it's the easiest tool to start with. 

This tutorial will help you to make your product onboarding experience right :love_letter::

For getting an inspiration for your onboarding emails you can check some examples from popular companies:
* [Email copy from great companies](http://www.goodemailcopy.com/) or [Really Good Emails site](https://reallygoodemails.com/).
* [Here Are All Of The Emails We Send At Drift](https://blog.drift.com/all-the-emails-at-drift/) from Drift team.
* [Pinterest Onboarding Emails](https://explore.reallygoodemails.com/pinterest-onboarding-emails-2c7fbb0424a9), by Bart King.
* And finally! Look this [mind-blowing UserOnboard site](http://www.useronboard.com/onboarding-teardowns/) with many examples of how popular web apps handle their onboarding experiences. The author, Samuel Hulick, made screenshots with explanations of every user step - from signing to the welcome email. 

When you have a new product release, you can use launch emails as an effective tool for growing users engagement:
* [The 20 Best Product Launch Emails That Reengage Users](https://www.appcues.com/blog/product-launch-emails/) by appcues.com team.
* [A little thing about release notes. Why they’re important to us, and how we approach the writing of them at Slack](https://slackhq.com/a-little-thing-about-release-notes-997d2e06842d)
* [A simple improvement to product announcements](https://blog.intercom.com/simple-improvement-product-mails/) from Intercome.

You should always A/B test different email headers, text, message styles, images, CTA buttons. Look at your metrics and measure how well is your onboarding experience works:
* [Everything You Wanted to Know About Email CTA Buttons](https://explore.reallygoodemails.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-email-cta-buttons-98807ab98806) by Really Good Emails.
* [Best Practices for Buttons: The User Experience of colors](https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-buttons-b7048479d440) by Luca Longo. One more short read to help you shoce your CTA button. 

You can work really hard and get a lot of traffic or trial signups. But if your onboarding experience and converting users to customers suck, you will lose the game. 


### :fearful: Cold emails
Most people hate cold outreach and everything connected to the direct sales. However, smart user-oriented cold emails can give you new users, partners or recommendations. I used this technique for getting feedback on early [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/). On average, 25% of people answered on my cold emails. 😟 I was afraid, that people will write me: "go fucking away with your spam!" But, nobody did it. The worst answer was: "not interested". So, there is no reason to avoid cold email marketing! 

* Learn from people, who run cold email campaigns, like this: [10 cold email tips I used to get 60,000 signups](https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/10-cold-email-tips-i-used-to-get-60-000-app-signups-dd928d86ca21) by Dunja Lazić.
* And here is some inspiring stories from Android Programmer at Basecamp, who just cold emailed people: [Admire someone? Write them an email, you might be surprised](https://m.signalvnoise.com/admire-someone-write-them-an-email-you-might-be-surprised-27e2f94f0fc1) by Dan Kim.
* These [11 Cold Email Templates & Examples](http://www.yesware.com/blog/cold-email-template/) are very creative! Grab some and personalize it for your target audience. Don't forget to do research before writing the cold email! You need to really know the person you are writing. Btw, these funny cool templates were done by Melissa Williams from Yesware. 
* And more [Sales Email Templates](https://attach.io/sales-email-templates/) from attach.io team, which can help you to write your own too.

## :bowtie: Building Partnerships 

Communication is the key to building any kind of relationships. Every social community has its own rules for this. Business people will prefer concise value driven messages when engineers are more open to deep well-thought-out talk. I encourage you to learn these social rules before writing a single line of LinkedIn invitation:
