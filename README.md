## Content Marketing 
Content Marketing is about promotion via content. You can run your personal blog, do guest-blogging or write at the popular industry platforms (or combine it). Focus on how you can help your users with your content. You don't have to be a professional writer for making cool articles. Just give yourself space to be creative and share your expertise. 

I encourage you to do a content-marketing by yourself because outsourcing it can be tricky (especially at the beginning). 
🤔 Firstly, think how your blog or content is you going to stand out. There are plenty of cool blogs in every industry. How are you going to be different? What unique value can you offer to your users? How can you build an engaged readers community? And the most important question is how you will convert these readers into leads. With all those considarations, you should create a content stategy:

## :cat: Marketing for Product Hunt Launch 
Product Hunt (PH) is a place to discover, share, and geek out about new products in tech. Submitting your product there is a good way to appear in front of journalists, tech people and fellow makers. After submission, the product will participate in the daily race. The race starts PST 00:00 and finishes PST 23:59. You have to get as many upvotes and comments as you can by the end of the day! :trophy: The most successful products appear on the Homepage and can get a lot of honest feedback, downloads, users and PR buzz. Please, check success PH stories to decide if PH is the right launch platform for you!

Start with [basic rules on Posting](https://help.producthunt.com/posting): how to post or comment, how to ask for support, how to get to the homepage. Then read [Five things everyone should know about Product Hunt](https://medium.com/product-hunt/five-things-everyone-should-know-about-product-hunt-fac74f44c32b).

## :email: Email Marketing
I know what you are thinking right now: "nobody cares about emails". Well, do you have your favorite newsletters? Do you love discount emails from your favorite dev tool? I bet, the answer is "yes" :smirk: The goal of email marketing is to turn email addresses into loyal users or prospect partners. 

### Product emails 
Product emails 

The goal of onboarding is to increase the number of users who actually use your product (or free trial) and pay for it later. Onboarding process can be done not only via emails. You can reach out to users through in-app messages, live chat messages, product tours, welcome modal windows, well-crafted UX or even phone calls :telephone_receiver:. For [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/) we decided to use a combination of triggered onboarding emails and in-app notifications. I will focus mostly on onboarding emails because it's the easiest tool to start with. 

This tutorial will help you to make your product onboarding experience right :love_letter::

* [Email copy from great companies](http://www.goodemailcopy.com/) or [Really Good Emails site](https://reallygoodemails.com/).

When you have a new product release, you can use launch emails as an effective tool for growing users engagement:

* [How Our Product Update Emails Get a 68% Response Rate](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/how-to-send-product-update-emails) by Groove Team.

You should always A/B test different email headers, text, message styles, images, CTA buttons. Look at your metrics and measure how well is your onboarding experience works:
* [Everything You Wanted to Know About Email CTA Buttons](https://explore.reallygoodemails.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-email-cta-buttons-98807ab98806) by Really Good Emails.
* [Best Practices for Buttons: The User Experience of colors](https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-buttons-b7048479d440) by Luca Longo. One more short read to help you shoce your CTA button. 

You can work really hard and get a lot of traffic or trial signups. But if your onboarding experience and converting users to customers suck, you will lose the game. 


## :fearful: Cold Email Marketing
Most people hate cold outreach and everything connected to the direct sales. However, smart user-oriented cold emails can give you new users, partners or recommendations. I used this technique for getting feedback on early [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/). On average, 25% of people answered on my cold emails. 😟 I was afraid, that people will write me: "go away with your spam!" But, nobody did that. The worst answer was: "not interested". So, there is no reason to avoid cold email marketing:
