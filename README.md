## :triumph: Marketing without Budget
Collection of marketing channels for getting the first users. Most of these ways will take a lot of time and effort, but don‚Äôt actually cost money to do it yourself. Some channels, like Content Marketing or Influencer Marketing are comprehensively explained in its own directories below.

## Content Marketing 
When you don't have money or expertise to do paid advertising, consider promotion via content. You can run your personal blog or do guest-blogging at the popular industry platforms\blogs (or both). Focus on how you can help your users with your content. You don't have to be a profesional writer for making a cool content. So give yourself space to be creative. 
:see_no_evil: Please, always check your grammar! I use these cool apps ‚Äî [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), [Ginger Grammar Checker](http://www.gingersoftware.com/grammarcheck) or browser extensions. Now it's time to write your first article :metal:

### :sunglasses: Personal Blog
Start off by creating a blog that not only touts your product but offers helpful advice, tips, tricks, links, etc. 

### :green_book: Medium Marketing
Medium is an online publishing platform with the huge active community. You can make your blog there and engage with your users and Medium readers. I want also show you the downside of using Medium versus your own blog:
-  Lower Conversion. 
You can get huge traffic to your Medium blog, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that people will go to your website or offering.
- No magic with getting traffic
You still need to promote your articles yourself.

### :mega: Promotion of your content
As you have already understood, you need to promote your content both for your own blog, Medium-like platforms or guest post at other blogs. Here some ideas how to promote your great articles: 


## Influencer Marketing
Influencer marketing is a type of marketing that focuses on working with opinioon leaders to drive a brand's message\product\service to the larger market.

## :cat: Marketing for Product Hunt Launch 
Product Hunt (PH) is a place to discover, share, and geek out about new products in tech. Submiting your product there is a good way to appear in front of journalists, tech people and fellow makers. After submission, the product will participate in the daily race. The race starts PST 00:00 and finishes PST 23:59. You have to get as many upvotes and comments as you can by the end of the day! :trophy: The most successful products appear on the Homepage and can get many honest feedback, downloads, users and PR buzz. Please, check success PH stories to decide if PH is the right launch platform for you!

Start with [basic rules on Posting](https://help.producthunt.com/posting): how to post or comment, how to ask for support, how to get to the homepage. Then read [Five things everyone should know about Product Hunt](https://medium.com/product-hunt/five-things-everyone-should-know-about-product-hunt-fac74f44c32b). Join the PH community and feel how it works, before actually starting you launch activities.

:scream: Successful PH launch takes a lot of preparation, promotion during the launch (24h++) and follow-up work. These guides will help you:

* [Product Hunt 101](https://medium.com/swlh/product-hunt-101-426511f03501) from one of the top-hunters, Robleh Jama. It's very useful to listen to the launch algorithm from the person, who submit a lot of different products.
* [The SaaS founder‚Äôs guide to Product Hunt](https://blog.amplifr.com/en/amplifr-on-producthunt/) from the Russian company, Amplifr. It's a nice tutorial around your product preparation (onboarding, language check, emails and other not obvious stuff).
* [Launching on Product Hunt: what works and what doesn‚Äôt [guide & case study]](https://hackernoon.com/launching-on-product-hunt-what-works-and-what-doesnt-guide-case-study-776c77d56e26) by 3D modeling app startup, who lauhcned on Product Hunt in December 2016. These folks have not typical "sweet product for startup audience" and their launch was "so-so" useful. I encourage you to think about resources you will invest in PH launch versus possible outcome!

Useful tools:
* [Notify](https://notify.ly/) notifies you in Slack when your startup is mentioned online. That helps you to answer\react quickly if somebody talks about your product (feedback, question).
* [MakerTools](http://makertools.xyz/) allows you to create a Twitter list of all the wonderful folks who upvoted your product. It's a good practise to thank those people for supporting you via Twitter üòç

## Social Media Marketing
### Twitter

Be awere of [Twitter tweet & DM limit](https://support.twitter.com/articles/15364).

## :email: Email Marketing
### Product emails 
Product Onboarding emails:

### :fearful: Cold emails
Most people hate cold outreach and everything connected to the direct sales. However, smart user-oriented cold emails can give you new users, partners or recommendations. I used this technique for getting feedback on early [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/). On everage, 25% of people answered on my cold emails. üòü I was afreid, that people will write me: "go fucking away with your spam!" But, nobody did it. The worst answer was: "not interested". So, there is no reason to avoid cold email marketing! 
  
* You can star from looking on [Sales Email Templates](https://attach.io/sales-email-templates/) from attach.io team. 
* Learn from people, who run cold email campaings, like this: [10 cold email tips I used to get 60,000 signups](https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/10-cold-email-tips-i-used-to-get-60-000-app-signups-dd928d86ca21) by Dunja Laziƒá.
* And here is some inspring stories from Android Programmer at Basecamp, who just cold emailed people: [Admire someone? Write them an email, you might be surprised](https://m.signalvnoise.com/admire-someone-write-them-an-email-you-might-be-surprised-27e2f94f0fc1) by Dan Kim.

Useful tools:
* [Norbert](https://www.voilanorbert.com/) for finding emails. It gives you 50 free email searches once you create an account.


## :bowtie: Building Partnerships 

Communication is the key for building any kind of relationships. Every social community has its own rules for this. Business people will prefer concise value driven messages, when engineers are more open to deep well-thought-out talk. I encourage you to learn these social rules before writing a single line of LinkedIn invitation:

* [How to Write Emails Like a CEO](https://medium.com/@Torbahax/how-to-write-emails-like-a-ceo-d6a2906611e0), by Andrew Torba

## üïµÔ∏è Psychology in Marketing 
If you want to make a deeper dive into the the user's brain, I will recommend you to learn disciplines on the intersection with marketing.


## :moneybag: Pricing 
We struggle in asking people to pay for your product or service.
* [How Much is Your App, Skill and Time Worth?](https://medium.com/mobile-growth/how-much-is-your-app-skill-and-time-worth-4386a7613fa1) by Peter Witham. It's more a philosophical read from my friend, who tries to prevent you from charging low price for you mobile apps or any other product.
