## :triumph: Marketing without Budget
You will find here a collection of free marketing channels for getting the first users. Most of it will take a lot of time & effort, but will not actually cost money to do it yourself. Some channels, like Content Marketing or Influencer Marketing are comprehensively explained in its own directories below. So, get fresh ideas from these real-life stories and think what could work for your users:
* [Do Things that Don't Scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) by Paul Graham. He is co-founder of Y Combinator, computer scientist, venture capitalist, and enterpreneur. This essay is a must-read for every stratup founder, indie developer or creator. You can also find many other useful essays in Paul Graham blog.
* [How to Grow Your Startup on a $0 Marketing Budget](https://producthabits.com/how-to-grow-your-startup-on-a-0-marketing-budget/) by Hiten Shah
* [How We Got Our First 2,000 Users Doing Things That Don‚Äôt Scale](https://www.fastcompany.com/3024472/how-we-got-our-first-2000-users-doing-things-that-dont-scale) by amazing [Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover), co-founder of Product Hunt.

We used many free marketing channels. 
To be honest, when we started Flawless App we didn't have other ways. We wrote cold emails, talk to influencers, manually rectuit users at events, post at Facebook developers groups, worked with developers\designers via Twitter and did many other clever trics. üéâ These gave us our first 1000 beta users üéâ So try it out! The only thing I ask you to keep in mind: Don't Become A Spammer :trollface:
  
## Content Marketing 
When you don't have money or expertise to do paid advertising, consider promotion via content. You can run your personal blog or do guest-blogging at the popular industry platforms\blogs (or both). Focus on how you can help your users with your articles. You don't have to be a profesional writer for making a cool content. Just give yourself space to be creative and share your expertise. I encorage you to do a content-marketing by yourself, because outsorsing it can be tricky (espesialy at the beginning).

:see_no_evil: Please, always check your grammar! I use these cool apps ‚Äî [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), [Ginger Grammar Checker](http://www.gingersoftware.com/grammarcheck) or browser extensions. Now it's time to write your first article :metal:

### :sunglasses: Personal Blog
Start off by creating a blog that not only touts your product but offers helpful advice, tips, tricks, links, etc. 

### :green_book: Medium Marketing
Medium is an online publishing platform with the huge active community. You can make your blog there and engage with your users and Medium readers. I want also show you the downside of using Medium versus your own blog:
-  Lower Conversion. 
You can get huge traffic to your Medium blog, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that people will go to your website or offering.
- No magic with getting traffic
You still need to promote your articles yourself.

### :mega: Promotion of your content
As you have already understood, you need to promote your content both for your own blog, Medium-like platforms or guest post at other blogs. Here some ideas how to promote your great articles: 


## Influencer Marketing
Influencer marketing is a type of marketing that focuses on working with opinioon leaders to drive a brand's message\product\service to the larger market.

## :cat: Marketing for Product Hunt Launch 
Product Hunt (PH) is a place to discover, share, and geek out about new products in tech. Submiting your product there is a good way to appear in front of journalists, tech people and fellow makers. After submission, the product will participate in the daily race. The race starts PST 00:00 and finishes PST 23:59. You have to get as many upvotes and comments as you can by the end of the day! :trophy: The most successful products appear on the Homepage and can get many honest feedback, downloads, users and PR buzz. Please, check success PH stories to decide if PH is the right launch platform for you!

Start with [basic rules on Posting](https://help.producthunt.com/posting): how to post or comment, how to ask for support, how to get to the homepage. Then read [Five things everyone should know about Product Hunt](https://medium.com/product-hunt/five-things-everyone-should-know-about-product-hunt-fac74f44c32b). Join the PH community and feel how it works, before actually starting you launch activities.

:scream: Successful PH launch takes a lot of preparation, promotion during the launch (24h++) and follow-up work. These guides will help you:

* [Product Hunt 101](https://medium.com/swlh/product-hunt-101-426511f03501) from one of the top-hunters, Robleh Jama. It's very useful to listen to the launch algorithm from the person, who submit a lot of different products.
* [The SaaS founder‚Äôs guide to Product Hunt](https://blog.amplifr.com/en/amplifr-on-producthunt/) from the Russian company, Amplifr. It's a nice tutorial around your product preparation (onboarding, language check, emails and other not obvious stuff).
* [Launching on Product Hunt: what works and what doesn‚Äôt [guide & case study]](https://hackernoon.com/launching-on-product-hunt-what-works-and-what-doesnt-guide-case-study-776c77d56e26) by 3D modeling app startup, who lauhcned on Product Hunt in December 2016. These folks have not typical "sweet product for startup audience" and their launch was "so-so" useful. I encourage you to think about resources you will invest in PH launch versus possible outcome!

Useful tools:
* [Notify](https://notify.ly/) notifies you in Slack when your startup is mentioned online. That helps you to answer\react quickly if somebody talks about your product (feedback, question).
* [MakerTools](http://makertools.xyz/) allows you to create a Twitter list of all the wonderful folks who upvoted your product. It's a good practise to thank those people for supporting you via Twitter üòç

## Social Media Marketing
### Twitter

Be awere of [Twitter tweet & DM limit](https://support.twitter.com/articles/15364).

## :email: Email Marketing
I know what you are thinking right now: "nobody cares about emails". Well, do you have your favorite newsletters? Do you love discount emails from your favorite dev tool? I bet, the answer is "yes" :smirk: The goal of email marketing is to turn email addresses into loyal users or prospect partners. 

### Product emails 
Product emails 

The goal of onboarding is to increase the number of users who actually use your product (or free trial) and pay for it later. Onboarding process can be done not only via emails. You can reach out to users through in-app messages, live chat messages, product tours, welcome modal windows, well-crafted UX or even phone calls :telephone_receiver:. For [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/) we decided to use a combination of triggered onboarding emails and in-app notifications. I will focus mostly on onboarding emails, becasue it's the easies tool to start with. 

These tutorial will help you to make your product onboarding experience right :love_letter:: 
* [The Anatomy of a Welcome Email](https://customer.io/blog/welcome-email-best-practices.html) by customer.io team.
* [Trial expiration email best practices](https://postmarkapp.com/guides/trial-expiration-email-best-practices) by Garrett Dimon.
* [Upgrade Emails that Convert](https://customer.io/blog/upgrade-email-templates.html) by customer.io team.
* [3 Lessons Learned From Testing Hundreds Of Onboarding Emails](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/email-onboarding-optimization) by Alex Turnbull, Groove founder. 
* [How to Bring Inactive Users Back from the Dead with Emails](https://www.appcues.com/blog/how-to-bring-inactive-users-back-from-the-dead/) by Ty Magnin from Appcues.

For getting an inspiration for your onboarding emails you can check some examples from popular companies:
* [Email copy from great companies](http://www.goodemailcopy.com/) by Front or [Really Good Emails site](https://reallygoodemails.com/).
* [Here Are All Of The Emails We Send At Drift](https://blog.drift.com/all-the-emails-at-drift/) from Drift team.
* [Pinterest Onboarding Emails](https://explore.reallygoodemails.com/pinterest-onboarding-emails-2c7fbb0424a9), by Bart King.
* And finally! Look this [mind-blowing UserOnboard site](http://www.useronboard.com/onboarding-teardowns/) with many-many examples of how popular web apps handle their onboarding experiences. The auther, Samuel Hulick, made screenshots with explanations of every user step - from signing to the welcome email. 

When you have a new product release, you can use launch emails as an effective tool for growing users engagement:
* [The 20 Best Product Launch Emails That Reengage Users](https://www.appcues.com/blog/product-launch-emails/) by appcues.com team.

You should always A/B test different email headers, text, message styles, images, CTA buttons. Look on your metricks and measure how well is your onboarding experience works:
* [Everything You Wanted to Know About Email CTA Buttons](https://explore.reallygoodemails.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-email-cta-buttons-98807ab98806) by Really Good Emails.

You can work really hard and get a lot of traffic or trial signups. But if your onboarding experience and converting users to customers suck, you will lose the game. 


### :fearful: Cold emails
Most people hate cold outreach and everything connected to the direct sales. However, smart user-oriented cold emails can give you new users, partners or recommendations. I used this technique for getting feedback on early [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/). On everage, 25% of people answered on my cold emails. üòü I was afreid, that people will write me: "go fucking away with your spam!" But, nobody did it. The worst answer was: "not interested". So, there is no reason to avoid cold email marketing! 

* Learn from people, who run cold email campaings, like this: [10 cold email tips I used to get 60,000 signups](https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/10-cold-email-tips-i-used-to-get-60-000-app-signups-dd928d86ca21) by Dunja Laziƒá.
* And here is some inspring stories from Android Programmer at Basecamp, who just cold emailed people: [Admire someone? Write them an email, you might be surprised](https://m.signalvnoise.com/admire-someone-write-them-an-email-you-might-be-surprised-27e2f94f0fc1) by Dan Kim.
* These [11 Cold Email Templates & Examples](http://www.yesware.com/blog/cold-email-template/) are very creative! Grab some and personalize it for your targer audience. Don't forget to do research before writing cold email! You need to really know the person you are writing. Btw, these funny cool templates were done by Melissa Williams from Yesware. 
* And more [Sales Email Templates](https://attach.io/sales-email-templates/) from attach.io team, which can help you to write your own too.

Useful tools:

## :bowtie: Building Partnerships 

Communication is the key for building any kind of relationships. Every social community has its own rules for this. Business people will prefer concise value driven messages, when engineers are more open to deep well-thought-out talk. I encourage you to learn these social rules before writing a single line of LinkedIn invitation:

## :moneybag: Pricing 
We struggle in asking people to pay for your product or service.
* [How Much is Your App, Skill and Time Worth?](https://medium.com/mobile-growth/how-much-is-your-app-skill-and-time-worth-4386a7613fa1) by Peter Witham. It's more a philosophical read from my friend, who tries to prevent you from charging low price for you mobile apps or any other product.
